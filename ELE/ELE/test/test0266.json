{"article": "One topic is rarely mentioned in all the talk of improving standards in our schools: the almost complete failure of foreign - language teaching. As a French graduate who has taught for more than twenty - five years, I believe I have some idea of why the failure is so total. _ the faults already found out in the education system as a whole - such as child - centred learning, the \"discovery\" method, and the low expectations by teachers of pupils - there have been several serious _ which have a direct effect on language teaching. The first is the removal from the curriculum of the thorough teaching of English _ . Pupils now do not know a verb from a noun, the subject of a sentence from its object, or the difference between the past, present, or future. Another important error is mixed - ability teaching, or teaching in ability groups so _ that the most able pupils are _ and are bored while the least able are lost and _ bored. Strangely enough, few head teachers seem to be in favour of mixed - ability school football teams. Progress depends on memory, and pupils start to forget immediately they stop having _ lessons. This is why many people who attended French lessons at school, even those who got good grades, have forgotten it a few years later. _ they never need it, they do not practise it. Most American schools have accepted what is inevitable and _ modern languages, even Spanish, from the curriculum. Perhaps it is time for Britain to do the same, and stop _ resources on a subject which few pupils want or need.", "options": [["Due to", "In addition to", "Instead of", "In spite of"], ["errors", "situations", "systems", "methods"], ["vocabulary", "culture", "grammar", "literature"], ["wide", "similar", "separate", "unique"], ["kept out", "turned down", "held back", "left behind"], ["surprisingly", "individually", "equally", "hardly"], ["extra", "traditional", "basic", "regular"], ["Although", "Because", "Until", "Unless"], ["restored", "absorbed", "prohibited", "withdrawn"], ["wasting", "focusing", "exploiting", "sharing"]], "answers": []}
