{"article": "What is your earliest childhood memory? Can you remember learning to walk? Or talk? The first time you heard thunder or watched a television program? Adults seldom _ events much earlier than the year or so before entering school, _ children younger than three or four _ retain any specific, personal experiences. A variety of explanations have been _ by psychologists for this \"childhood a mnesia\". One argues that the hippocampus, the region of the brain which is _ for forming memories, does not mature until about the age of two. But the most popular theory _ that, since adults don't think like children, they cannot _ childhood memories. Adults think in words, and their life memories are like stories or _ - one event follows _ as in a novel or film. But when they search through their mental _ for early childhood memories to add to this verbal life story, they don't find any that fit the _ . It's like trying to find a Chinese word in an English dictionary. Now psychologist Annette Simms of the New York State University offers a new _ for childhood amnesia. She argues that there simply _ any early childhood memories to recall. According to Dr Simms, children need to learn to use someone else's spoken description of their personal _ in order to turn their own short term, quickly forgotten _ of them into long term memories. In other _ , children have to talk about their experiences and hear others talk about _ - Mother talking about the afternoon _ looking for seashells at the beach or Dad asking them about their day at Ocean Park. Without this _ reinforcement, says Dr Simms, children cannot form _ memories of their personal experiences.", "options": [["figure", "interpret", "recall", "affirm"], ["now that", "even if", "as though", "just as"], ["largely", "rarely", "merely", "really"], ["refuted", "defied", "proposed", "witnessed"], ["responsible", "suitable", "favorable", "available"], ["declines", "assesses", "estimates", "maintains"], ["reflect", "attain", "access", "acquire"], ["narratives", "forecasts", "communications", "descriptions"], ["the rest", "another", "the other", "others"], ["deposits", "dreams", "flashes", "files"], ["model", "pattern", "frame", "formula"], ["emphasis", "assertion", "explanation", "assumption"], ["aren't", "weren't", "isn't", "was't"], ["instincts", "feelings", "sensations", "experiences"], ["impressions", "beliefs", "minds", "insights"], ["senses", "cases", "words", "aspects"], ["him", "their", "it", "them"], ["taken", "utilized", "applied", "spent"], ["habitual", "verbal", "unique", "particular"], ["permanent", "mental", "spiritual", "conscious"]], "answers": []}
