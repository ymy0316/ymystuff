{"article": "My friend Dom recently set himself a 21-day kindness challenge. Dom took up this challenge because he had been _ some difficult times after a relationship breakup. Instead of feeling _ for himself, he turned a negative into a positive. He started Mother's Day by _ his mother at her work with his brothers. He had won some money before, so on Day Two he donated some of his _ to a local disability organization. Later that day, the local district was _ by strong winds so he _ his elderly neighbour's gutters on Day Three. On Day Four he _ some elders in the retirement village, chatting with them. Trading in his car _ for a bicycle helmet for the next two days was Dom's way of being _ to the environment. On Day Seven and Eight he picked up rubbish that was _ the river shore and he drove to the blood bank to make his blood _ And then on Day Nine he bought a lottery ticket and put it in an envelope with Act Of Kindness _ on it before sending it. On Day Ten my daughter and I found ourselves _ in a supermarket car park with a flat battery. I called Dom, who came to our _ with a smile and _ started the car so we could get home. And so Dom's kindness continued for _ eleven days. He _ people to check his Facebook wall each day to see what he had achieved with the _ that others would feel inspired. His posts attracted more and more likes _ the days went on. I have loved every minute of this, he posted on the last day. I encourage you all to _ your comfort zone to continue the challenge.", "options": [["over", "through", "into", "from"], ["cheerful", "guilty", "grateful", "sorry"], ["praising", "surprising", "waking", "facing"], ["winnings", "belongings", "salary", "payments"], ["blown", "caught", "hit", "destroyed"], ["swept over", "cleaned out", "looked into", "checked out"], ["examined", "inspected", "visited", "informed"], ["doors", "lights", "windows", "keys"], ["polite", "kind", "useful", "equal"], ["littering", "filling", "making", "landing"], ["test", "donation", "file", "discovery"], ["written", "drawn", "signed", "carved"], ["covered", "locked", "stuck", "dropped"], ["life", "rescue", "house", "mind"], ["lightly", "successfully", "suddenly", "jokingly"], ["other", "more", "just", "another"], ["persuaded", "needed", "invited", "taught"], ["meaning", "fact", "hope", "secret"], ["as", "since", "while", "after"], ["step out of", "set up", "move into", "turn to"]], "answers": []}
