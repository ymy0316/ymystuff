{"article": " The Belief of a Teacher When I say all children can learn, people sometimes misunderstand. They think I am saying that _ you give a bright kid from a poor family good education, he can succeed. That's absolutely true, but that's not _ I mean. I believe that all kids can learn, I believe it, I've seen it and I've even _ it. Back in 1975 when I graduated, I worked for emotionally _ kids, kids that everyone _ their parents had given up on. What we would do was cook with the kids. These children didn't tell baking powder _ table salt, but _ they had eaten a warm biscuit, they wanted to learn how to make some more. Suddenly, kids who couldn't focus were _ eyeballing ingredients as we measured them out, learning _ math and spelling lessons we could slip in along the way.

That's _ the kids with problems are not going to _ start teaching themselves. We have to help them by finding out what _ them and exploiting it shamelessly. When I was growing up poor, I probably looked like I was heading _ . And I would have ended up dead or in jail _ a couple of teachers. They _ my fascination with reading and made sure I had great books _ . Because of that, I have devoted my life to the poorest communities _ making sure kids like me don't get written off.
