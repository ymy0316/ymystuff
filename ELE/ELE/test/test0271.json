{"article": "In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to supervise a series of industrial experiments at a large telephone-parts factory called the Hawthorne Plant near Chicago. It hoped they would learn how stop-floor lighting _ workers' productivity. Instead, the studies ended _ giving their name to the \"Hawthorne effect\", the extremely influential idea that the very _ to being experimented upon changed subjects' behavior. The idea arose because of the behavior of the women in the _ Hawthorne plant. According to _ of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting was increased, but also when it was dimmed. It did not _ what was done in the experiment; _ something was changed, productivity rose. A(n) _ that they were being experimented upon seemed to be _ to alter workers' behavior _ itself. After several decades, the same data were _ to econometric the analysis. Hawthorne experiments has another surprise store _ the descriptions on record, no systematic _ was found that levels of productivity were related to changes in lighting. It turns out that peculiar way of conducting the experiments may be have let to _ interpretation of what happed. _ , lighting was always changed on a Sunday. When work started again on Monday, output _ rose compared with the previous Saturday and _ to rise for the next couple of days. _ , a comparison with data for weeks when there was no experimentation showed that output always went up on Monday, workers _ to be diligent for the first few days of the week in any case, before _ a plateau and then slackening off. This suggests that the alleged \"Hawthorne effect\" is hard to pin down.", "options": [["affected", "achieved", "extracted", "restored"], ["at", "up", "with", "off"], ["truth", "sight", "act", "proof"], ["controversial", "perplexing", "mischievous", "ambiguous"], ["requirements", "explanations", "accounts", "assessments"], ["conclude", "matter", "indicate", "work"], ["as far as", "for fear that", "in case that", "so long as"], ["awareness", "expectation", "sentiment", "illusion"], ["suitable", "excessive", "enough", "abundant"], ["about", "for", "on", "by"], ["compared", "shown", "subjected", "conveyed"], ["contrary to", "consistent with", "parallel with", "peculiar to"], ["evidence", "guidance", "implication", "source"], ["disputable", "enlightening", "reliable", "misleading"], ["In contrast", "For example", "In consequence", "As usual"], ["duly", "accidentally", "unpredictably", "suddenly"], ["failed", "ceased", "started", "continued"], ["Therefore", "Furthermore", "However", "Meanwhile"], ["attempted", "tended", "chose", "intended"], ["breaking", "climbing", "surpassing", "hitting"]], "answers": []}
