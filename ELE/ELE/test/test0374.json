{"article": "Aging poses a serious challenge to OECD Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development countries in particular how to pay for future public pension liabilities. And early retirement places an _ burden on pension financing. There is no easy solution but _ retirement could help.Early retirement may seem like a worthy individual goal but it is a socially _ one and makes the present public pension system difficult to sustain for long. The _ reason is that more people are retiring early and living longer. That means more retirees depending on the _ of those in work for their income. The _ is worrying. In the next 50 years low fertility rates and _ life expectancy in OECD countries will cause this old-age dependency rate to roughly double _ size. Public pension payments which afford 30-80% of total retirement incomes in OECD countries are _ to rise on average by over three percentage points in GDP and by as much as eight percentage points in some countries. _ is the pressure on pension funds that there is a danger of today s workers not getting the pensions they expected or felt they _ for.Action is needed _ simply aiming to reduce the _ and cost of public pensions or trying to _ the role of privately funded pensions within the system though necessary steps may be _ to deal with the dependency challenge. After years of _ early retirement schemes to avoid _ and higher unemployment many governments are now looking _ persuading people to stay in work until they are older. Surely the thinking goes if we are healthier now and jobs are physically less _ and unemployment is down then perhaps the _ rate should rise anew.", "options": [["unsolvable", "additional", "unsustainable", "undue"], ["delaying", "retaining", "detaining", "hindering"], ["ultimate", "unattainable", "specific", "expensive"], ["substantial", "essential", "potential", "controversial"], ["donating", "sponsoring", "subsidizing", "funding"], ["outlook", "outcome", "outbreak", "outset"], ["prolonging", "expanding", "soaring", "rising"], ["in", "on", "by", "for"], ["conceived", "reckoned", "expected", "meant"], ["As", "Such", "So", "It"], ["should pay", "paying", "be paid", "would pay"], ["but", "for", "and", "thus"], ["multitude", "implementation", "application", "generosity"], ["exaggerate", "augment", "magnify", "multiply"], ["insufficient", "influential", "inefficient", "intrinsic"], ["advancing", "previous", "ahead", "preceding"], ["suspensions", "abundances", "redundancies", "discrepancies"], ["for", "to", "about", "at"], ["turbulent", "strenuous", "compact", "intricate"], ["dependency", "fertility", "present", "mortality"]], "answers": []}
