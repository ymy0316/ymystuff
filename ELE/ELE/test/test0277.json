{"article": "The house next door had been empty for so long that we had quite forgotten what it was to have neighbours. One day, _ , a great furniture lorry drew up near our front gate and in a short time, all kinds of furniture were _ on the pavement. A small car arrived, out of which came seven people: a man, a woman and five children of _ ages. The children hurried out and began laughing _ as the whole family moved into the house. Windows were _ open; furniture was put into _ ; and little faces looked curiously at us over the fence and disappeared. It was our first _ to the Robinsons. Though we became good _ with our new neighbours, we often had causes to be made angry by them. Our garden became an unsafe place: little boys _ as cowboys or Indians would jump up from behind bushes, _ wooden guns at us and _ us to put our hands up. Sometimes our lives were _ ; at others, we were killed with a _ \"Bang! Bang!\"Even more dangerous were the arrows that occasionally came sailing _ the garden fence. But we did not _ go in fear of our lives. The Robinsons were friendly and helpful and when we left for the holidays, we knew we had nothing to fear _ our neighbours were around. We understood what it was like to have _ in the long, friendless, winter evenings _ Mr.Robinson would _ in for a cup of tea and chat; or when Mr Robinson would _ over the fence and talk endlessly with Father about gardening problems.", "options": [["but", "therefore", "however", "strangely"], ["unloaded", "removed", "loaded", "destroyed"], ["the same", "various", "young", "middle"], ["happily", "sadly", "astonishingly", "terribly"], ["broken", "kicked", "forced", "pushed"], ["place", "room", "order", "use"], ["management", "introduction", "interview", "arrangement"], ["enemies", "strangers", "friends", "relatives"], ["looked", "pretended", "dressed", "worn"], ["throw", "put", "fire", "point"], ["ask", "order", "make", "lead"], ["saved", "wasted", "devoted", "spared"], ["soft", "sharp", "funny", "slow"], ["on", "through", "over", "across"], ["always", "every", "sometimes", "then"], ["unless", "though", "so long as", "even if"], ["fun", "cheers", "discussions", "company"], ["while", "when", "as", "since"], ["drop", "slip", "jump", "break"], ["climb", "fall", "lean", "lie"]], "answers": []}
