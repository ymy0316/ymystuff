{"article": "The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, _ this is largely because, _ animals ,we stand upright. This means that our noses are _ to perceiving those smells which float through the air, _ the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact _ , we are extremely sensitive to smells, _ we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of _ human smells even when these are _ to far below one part in one million. Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, _ others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate _ smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send _ to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell _ can suddenly become sensitive to it when _ to it often enough. The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that brain finds it _ to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can _ new receptors if necessary. This may _ explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells we simply do not need to be. We are not _ of the usual smell of our own house but we _ new smells when we visit someone else's. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors _ for unfamiliar and emergency signals _ the smell of smoke, which might indicate the danger of fire.", "options": [["although", "as", "but", "while"], ["above", "unlike", "excluding", "besides"], ["limited", "committed", "dedicated", "confined"], ["catching", "ignoring", "missing", "tracking"], ["anyway", "though", "instead", "therefore"], ["even if", "if only", "only if", "as if"], ["distinguishing", "discovering", "determining", "detecting"], ["diluted", "dissolved", "determining", "diffused"], ["when", "since", "for", "whereas"], ["unusual", "particular", "unique", "typical"], ["signs", "stimuli", "messages", "impulses"], ["at first", "at all", "at large", "at times"], ["subjected", "left", "drawn", "exposed"], ["ineffective", "incompetent", "inefficient", "insufficient"], ["introduce", "summon", "trigger", "create"], ["still", "also", "otherwise", "nevertheless"], ["sure", "sick", "aware", "tired"], ["tolerate", "repel", "neglect", "notice"], ["availabe", "reliable", "identifiable", "suitable"], ["similar to", "such as", "along with", "aside from"]], "answers": []}
