{"article": "I want to share a moving story with you. A friend, who started up and ran her own youth _ group, lost her husband because of cancer 2 years ago. Almost after he _ she found out that she had _ too. She is still going strong and her _ is working well for now. She always has a smile and kind words for everyone, just as she usually did during the _ days. One of the _ I have had over the years is to -take photographs _ candid shots of people laughing and smiling. I have a great headshot of the fried and her husband, from about a year or 2 before he died. They _ have the loveliest smiles in the photo. An idea came into my mind when I _ the photo. So I ordered a(n) _ of it and put it into a nice frame for her. I gave it to her last night at a meeting of the theater group. I didn't know if she would like it, so I was very _ of how it might go. _ there were floods of tears from her and a few other friends, we all had lots of hags and _ It was a friendly and warm _ that I hadn't had for many years. My friend said, It is one of the nicest _ I have of him and, though I normally _ pictures of myself, I love this one. She couldn't _ me enough and was really shocked that I had done such a(n) _ thing for her. I felt it was only a _ effort on my part, but it _ an amazing result.", "options": [["theater", "painting", "science", "literature"], ["escaped", "died", "recovered", "approached"], ["energy", "cancer", "creation", "wealth"], ["schedule", "method", "treatment", "arrangement"], ["meaningful", "joyful", "precious", "previous"], ["hobbies", "collections", "advantages", "achievements"], ["suddenly", "fortunately", "approximately", "particularly"], ["both", "never", "neither", "rather"], ["took", "sent", "scanned", "described"], ["meal", "enlargement", "ticket", "celebration"], ["frightened", "nervous", "proud", "doubtful"], ["Because", "Unless", "Although", "Once"], ["smiles", "plans", "friends", "messages"], ["weather", "reception", "scene", "color"], ["presents", "relations", "memories", "pictures"], ["recall", "design", "store", "dislike"], ["thank", "teach", "bless", "forgive"], ["expensive", "complex", "equal", "thoughtful"], ["continuous", "tiny", "special", "final"], ["gave up", "looked for", "brought about", "waited for"]], "answers": []}
