{"article": "I recently joined an organization called Kindness Water, which was _ by Phillip Wagner. One day when he was reading the newspaper, he _ a story about Africa and was _ to learn that 3.6 million people died every year. The reason why they died was _ there was not enough clean drinking water. He knew he had to help. So he _ money from friends and churches to help the people in a Malawai village to dig a well . Then he set up a bottled water company and 100% of the money he made was used to _ more wells. Within a year, he gave a hand to more people in Uganda. Since then there have been 550wells in 19countries and more than 325000 people have been helped. But here is what really _ me: It all started with one man, Phillip Wagner who wanted to make a difference. He saw a need and he did what he could to help those in trouble. Thousands of others who read the same _ that morning might have also been surprised when they learned the _ that so many people didn't have clean drinking water. But all those people didn't _ . They thought, \"Oh well. That's too bad. _ , somebody will help those _ don't have any clean water.\" Phillip Wagner decided to be that somebody, and _ the help of thousands of others who have joined, he is making a difference to the world. You see, _ change starts with ordinary people doing their _ . I want to be one of those _ makers. As a video of children smiling and swimming in clean water rolled in the background, Phillip Wagner said, I just want you to know that I _ my all, did my best, brought happiness to someone and _ this world a little better just because I was here.\" Let's live out those words today. _ you choose to help the homeless people or _ any other good things for those in need, let's be difference makers. Let's leave this world a little better.", "options": [["started", "scheduled", "recognized", "attended"], ["set down", "thought of", "made up", "came across"], ["calm", "surprised", "excited", "lucky"], ["because", "when", "that", "how"], ["found", "collected", "earned", "cost"], ["sell", "fill", "build", "buy"], ["changed", "moved", "concerned", "excited"], ["book", "magazine", "article", "picture"], ["idea", "attitude", "organization", "fact"], ["act", "ignore", "prepare", "join"], ["Frequently", "Smoothly", "Gradually", "Hopefully"], ["who", "which", "whom", "they"], ["under", "from", "with", "by"], ["real", "hard", "little", "frequent"], ["things", "housework", "work", "part"], ["decision", "dream", "water", "difference"], ["showed", "gave", "lost", "threw"], ["left", "guided", "promised", "wished"], ["If", "Whether", "Since", "Before"], ["record", "remember", "do", "know"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "B", "C", "B", "C", "B", "C", "D", "A", "D", "A", "C", "A", "D", "D", "B", "A", "B", "C"]}
