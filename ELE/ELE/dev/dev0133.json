{"article": "When I was a child of seven years old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went at once to a shop where they sold toys for children. Being _ with the sound of a whistle that I had seen by the way, in the hands of another boy, I _ all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but _ all the family. My brothers and sisters and cousins, when I told of the _ I had made, said I had given four times as much as the whistle was worth. They put me in mind of what good things I might have bought with the _ of the money, and laughed at me so much for my folly that I cried with vexation . Thinking about the matter gave me more _ than the whistle gave me pleasure. _ this was afterwards of use to me, for the impression continued _ my mind, so that often, when I was _ to buy something I did not need, I said to myself, Don't give too much for the whistle, and I saved my money. As I grew up, came into the world, and _ the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle. If I knew a miser who _ every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens and the joys of friendship, _ gathering and keeping wealth _ man, said I, you pay too dear for your whistle. When I met a man of pleasure, who did not try to improve his mind or his fortune but _ devoted himself to having a good time, perhaps _ his health, Mistaken man, you are providing _ for yourself, instead of pleasure; you are paying too dear for your whistle. If I saw someone fond of _ who has fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine earrings, all above his _ , and for which he had run into debt, and ended his career in a prison. Also, said I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle. _ , the miseries of mankind are largely due to their puffing a(n) _ value on things to giving too much for their whistle.", "options": [["faced", "charmed", "sympathized", "provided"], ["set aside", "put up", "handed over", "took over"], ["disturbing", "attracting", "entertaining", "confusing"], ["trouble", "attempt", "choice", "bargain"], ["rest", "value", "majority", "part"], ["satisfaction", "relief", "annoyance", "stress"], ["Moreover", "Therefore", "However", "Indeed"], ["out of", "on", "to", "from"], ["tempted", "determined", "forced", "persuaded"], ["took", "observed", "admired", "followed"], ["turned against", "gave up", "cared about", "relied on"], ["in case of", "instead of", "for the sake of", "in terms of"], ["Wealthy", "Poor", "Wise", "Innocent"], ["merely", "similarly", "strangely", "positively"], ["cherishing", "enjoying", "benefiting", "neglecting"], ["inconvenience", "burden", "frustration", "pain"], ["appearance", "wealth", "comforts", "necessities"], ["demand", "fortune", "standard", "value"], ["As a result", "By contrast", "On average", "In short"], ["unexpected", "great", "false", "extra"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "C", "B", "A", "B", "B", "C", "B", "A", "D", "D", "A", "B", "D", "C"]}
