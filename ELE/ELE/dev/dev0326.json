{"article": "In October 2002, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank _ a new electronic market for economic indices that _ substantial economic risks, such as nonfarm payroll (a measure of job availability) and retail sales. This new market was made possible by a _ rating technology, developed by Longitude, a New York company providing software for financial markets, _ the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction. This is \"digital\" _ of a digital option: i.e., it pays out only if an underlying index lies in a narrow, discrete range. In effect, Longitude has created a horse race, where each \"horse\" wins if and _ the specified index falls in a specified range. By creating horses for every possibl _ of the index, and allowing people to bet _ any number of runners, the company has produced a liquid integrated electronic market for a wide array options on economic indices. Ten years ago it was _ impossible to make use of electronic information about home values. Now, mortgage lenders have online automated valuation models that allow them to estimate values and to _ the risk in their portfolios. This has led to a proliferation of types of home loan, some of _ have improved risk-management characteristics. We are also beginning to see new kinds of _ for homes, which will make it possible to protect the value of _ , for most people, is the single most important _ of their wealth. The Yale University-Neighbourhood Reinvestment Corporation programme, _ last year in the city of Syracuse, in New York state, may be a model for home-equity insurance policies that _ sophisticated economic indices of house prices to define the _ of the policy. Electronic futures markets that are based on econometric indices of house prices by city, already begun by City Index and IG Index in Britain and now _ developed in the United States, will enable home-equity insurers to hedge the risks that they acquire by writing these policies. These examples are not impressive successes yet. But they _ as early precursors of a technology that should one day help us to deal with the massive risks of inequality that _ will beset us in coming years.", "options": [["created", "generated", "initiated", "originated"], ["reproduce", "restore", "represent", "resume"], ["sophisticated", "expensive", "available", "established"], ["made", "called", "asked", "read"], ["in the course", "in the event", "in the light", "in the sense"], ["when", "until", "now that", "only if"], ["extent", "range", "line", "area"], ["for", "in", "on", "up"], ["virtually", "admittedly", "absolutely", "originally"], ["assume", "assess", "dismiss", "erase"], ["them", "which", "that", "whom"], ["management", "insurance", "security", "technology"], ["what", "those", "where", "it"], ["guarantee", "protection", "component", "source"], ["secured", "sponsored", "released", "launched"], ["look to", "set up", "lay down", "rely on"], ["terms", "specifications", "concepts", "consequences"], ["is", "being", "been", "are"], ["emerge", "appear", "stand", "arise"], ["somehow", "anyway", "otherwise", "thereby"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "A", "B", "D", "D", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "A", "B", "C", "C"]}
