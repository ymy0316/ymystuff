Schools _ a higher percentage of early-decision applicants, which arguably means that you have a better chance of being enrolled. And if you do, you're done with the whole painful process by December. But most students and parents don't realize that schools have hidden _ for offering early decision. Early decision, since it's binding, allows schools to fill their classes with qualified students; it allows _ committees to select the students that are in particular demand for their college and know those students will come. It also gives schools a higher yield rate , which is often used as one of the ways to _ college selectivity and popularity.

Students who have done their research and are confident that there's one school they would be thrilled to get into should, under the current system, probably _ under early decision. For students who haven't yet done enough research, or who are still constantly changing their minds on favorite schools, the early-decision system needlessly and prematurely _ the field of possibility just at a time when students should be opening themselves to a whole range of thrilling options.", "options": [["let in", "turn down", "make up", "give away"], ["dangers", "costs", "assumptions", "purposes"], ["admissions", "joint", "inquiry", "investigative"], ["detail", "measure", "achieve", "represent"], ["neglects", "provides", "shortens", "marks"], ["future", "regular", "random", "compulsory"], ["informed", "honoured", "imposed", "complicated"], ["fit", "aid", "hit", "net"], ["therefore", "otherwise", "however", "furthermore"], ["comment", "enhancement", "implication", "reflection"], ["mutual", "favourite", "numerous", "temporary"], ["In other words", "In this regard", "In particular", "In brief"], ["hesitantly", "relatively", "deliberately", "efficiently"], ["consult", "volunteer", "adjust", "apply"], ["occupies", "encloses", "narrows", "explores"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "A", "B", "C", "B", "A", "A", "B", "D", "C", "B", "D", "D", "C"]}
