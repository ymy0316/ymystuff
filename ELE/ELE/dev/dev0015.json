{"article": ", , In 2003 I started my work at my local animal shelter's Adoption Department. Over the years, more than 50,000 animals have _ the doors of the shelter. Most of them, I do not remember. But occasionally there are animals who _ me so deeply that I could never possibly _ them. Tabby was one such animal. Tabby was an old dog, about 14 years old. What's more, she was blind and deaf. Tabby's chances at adoption seemed _ at best. After all, we didn't have may adopters coming in _ about her. We had all thought that Tabby would _ the rest of her life at the shelter. One day a woman named Loretta came to the shelter. Her son, Gary, had _ Tabby's picture and stories on the shelter's website. They were _ in meeting her! It was the only _ we ever received about Tabby. What could a young child _ see in a 14-year-old dog who was both blind and deaf? Most boys would want a dog who could grow with him and _ through grassy fields on summer days. Tabby would _ be able to do that. But after meeting her, Loretta and Gary decided that she was the right dog for their family. They adopted Tabby! If Tabby's story had simply ended with her _ adoption, it would still have been something very _ indeed. However, it was what happened after her adoption that some might label as \"magical\". Gary _ from seizures. As Gary and Tabby bonded they became _ . They did everything together. They became so \"intune\" with one another that Tabby began to telegraph Gary's seizures _ they occurred, giving his family warning that one was about to strike. What's more, Gary seemed to be having fewer and fewer seizures since Tabby's _ . How could it be? Nobody could explain _ Tabby did it. But those of us who were _ enough to know her and her family had seen a real miracle, the kind that has its roots in love.", "options": [["broke", "blocked", "passed", "approached"], ["amuse", "touch", "hurt", "shock"], ["leave", "catch", "beat", "forget"], ["remote", "great", "fair", "real"], ["arguing", "asking", "wondering", "worrying"], ["give up", "put off", "take over", "live out"], ["seen", "edited", "posted", "drawn"], ["disappointed", "experienced", "interested", "concerned"], ["call", "letter", "donation", "enquiry"], ["certainly", "frequently", "possibly", "urgently"], ["run", "look", "get", "break"], ["just", "never", "sometimes", "still"], ["general", "ordinary", "temporary", "successful"], ["strange", "special", "simple", "serious"], ["suffered", "learned", "died", "survived"], ["unattractive", "uncomfortable", "inseparable", "inconvenient"], ["since", "unless", "although", "before"], ["arrival", "birth", "return", "recovery"], ["when", "how", "where", "why"], ["eager", "curious", "fortunate", "confident"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "D", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "B", "C"]}
