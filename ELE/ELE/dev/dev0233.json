I was also _ : My high school coach Jarvis, who not only believed in me, but taught me how to believe in myself. He _ me the difference between having a dream and showing conviction . One particular incident with Coach Jarvis changed my life forever.It was the summer between my junior and senior years, and a friend _ me for a summer job. This meant a chance for money in my pocket cash for dates with girls, certainly, money for a new bike and new clothes, and the _ of savings for a house for my mother.
