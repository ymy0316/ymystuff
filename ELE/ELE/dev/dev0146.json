{"article": "Have you ever imagined your future? I try to do this all the time. Most of us will follow in our _ footsteps, by this I mean our adult lives will _ resemble the lives we live as children, set by our parents' examples. Have you ever _ and thought about this? What an awful job it must be to _ a child properly! But, what happens to the children that live _ drugs, alcohol and violence in their childhood? Where can they find good examples for themselves? I know of one place that is trying to _ all children. It is the McDowell County D.A.R.E. program in McDowell County North Carolina. Our teachers carry on their shoulders the great _ of teaching kids to just say NO to drugs, alcohol and violence. I am personally acquainted with _ of these things, not because I have ever _ them myself, but because of my dad. He drank, _ drugs and smoked pot . When I was 7 my mom took me and my sister and _ . I wonder if my dad ever thought about the _ and what this bad decision would lead to when he first started experimenting with drugs and pot at 13. He has been in jail, he can't get a decent job, and he lost his _ . These bad choices also caused him to hurt his children in horrible ways. I am _ that I have at least one parent to help me make wise decisions, and to teach me right from wrong. I am also _ that the D.A.R.E. program is taught in our schools. One of the most _ things I learned from D.A.R.E. is that a person that has a parent with an addiction problem is more than twice as likely to become addicted themselves, as compared to a person that has no family history of drug _ . I have learned many things through this _ , especially about the consequences of our trying drugs. You could get arrested, hurt yourself or someone else, _ your life by becoming an addict, or even die. All of these things are terrible, but I can't think of anything _ as a parent than hurting our children and the people that love us. DRUGS DESTROY LIVES! I give the D.A.R.E. program two thumbs up, for all the good things being accomplished.", "options": [["grandma's", "brother's", "parents'", "teachers'"], ["closely", "loosely", "hardly", "physically"], ["lived", "stopped", "started", "decided"], ["praise", "understand", "appreciate", "raise"], ["on", "over", "in", "for"], ["treat", "represent", "reach", "persuade"], ["pressure", "responsibility", "probability", "advantage"], ["both", "all", "none", "neither"], ["smoked", "accepted", "tried", "refused"], ["ate", "sold", "took", "bought"], ["went", "wept", "begged", "left"], ["reasons", "possibilities", "program", "consequences"], ["patience", "temper", "family", "position"], ["lucky", "aware", "sure", "clear"], ["concerned", "disappointed", "curious", "grateful"], ["important", "exciting", "strange", "attractive"], ["sales", "purchases", "abuse", "production"], ["behavior", "program", "experience", "action"], ["destroy", "build", "save", "lose"], ["wiser", "easier", "worse", "better"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D", "D", "C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "C"]}
