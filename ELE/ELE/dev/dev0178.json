{"article": "Molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn shared a Nobel Prize for her research on telomeres structures at the tips of chromosomes that play a key role in cellular aging. _ she was frustrated that the important health implications of her work weren't reaching beyond academia. So along with psychologist Elissa Epel, she has published her findings in a new book _ a general audience -- laying out a scientific case that may give readers _ to keep their new year's resolutions to not smoke, eat well, sleep enough, exercise regularly, and _ stress. The main message of The Telomere Effect, being published Tuesday, is that you have more control over your own aging than you may imagine. You can actually _ your telomeres and perhaps your life by following sound health advice, the authors argue, based on a review of thousands of studies. \"Telomeres listen to you, they listen to your _ , they listen to your state of mind,\" said Blackburn, president of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolia, Calif. Telomeres sit at the end of the strands of DNA, like the _ caps on shoelaces. Stress from a rough lifestyle will shorten those caps, making it more likely that cells will _ dividing and essentially die. Too many of these cells accelerate _ , the pair say. This doesn't cause any particular disease, but research suggests that it speeds up the time when whatever your genes have in store will occur -- so if you're _ to heart disease, you're more likely to get it younger if your telomeres are shorter, said Epel, director of the University of California, San Francisco's Aging, Metabolism and Emotions Center. \"We can provide a new level of specificity and tell people more precisely with clues _ from telomere science, about what exactly _ is related to long telomeres, what exact foods are related to long telomeres, what aspects of sleep are more related to long telomeres,\" Epel added. Other researchers in the field praised Blackburn and Epel's efforts to make telomere research relevant to the general public, _ several warned that it risked _ the science. \"I think it's a very difficult thing to prove that lifestyle can affect telomere length and therefore lifespan,\" said Harvard geneticist and anti-aging researcher David Sinclair. \"To get cause-effect in humans is _ , so it's based on associations.\"", "options": [["Hence", "Furthermore", "But", "And"], ["referred to", "addressed to", "aimed at", "informed of"], ["implication", "warning", "appealing", "motivation"], ["cut down on", "contribute to", "lay emphasis on", "add to"], ["enhance", "lengthen", "shorten", "simplify"], ["extinction", "behaviors", "instincts", "attitudes"], ["influential", "inevitable", "progressive", "protective"], ["initiate", "neglect", "cease", "maintain"], ["human health", "human aging", "human resolution", "psychological stress"], ["relevant", "sensitive", "reluctant", "dedicated"], ["emerging", "suffering", "profiting", "suspending"], ["illness", "gene", "smoking", "exercise"], ["though", "because", "so", "or"], ["overestimating", "oversimplifying", "underestimating", "over-viewing"], ["impropriate", "impossible", "irrelevant", "imaginary"]], "answers": ["C", "C", "D", "A", "B", "B", "D", "C", "B", "B", "A", "D", "A", "B", "B"]}
