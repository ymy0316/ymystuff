{"article": "Given the advantages of electronic money, you might think that we would move quickly to the cashless society in which all payments are made electronically. _ a true cashless society is probably not around the corner. Indeed, predictions have been _ for two decades but have not yet come to fruition. For example, Business Week predicted in 1975 that electronic means of payment would soon \"revolutionize the very _ of money itself,\" only to _ itself several years later. Why has the movement to a cashless society been so _ in coming? Although electronic means of payment may be more efficient than a payments system based on paper, several factors work _ the disappearance of the paper system. First, it is very _ to set up the computer, card reader, and telecommunications networks necessary to make electronic money the _ form of payment Second, paper checks have the advantage that they _ receipts, something that many consumers are unwilling to _ . Third, the use of paper checks gives consumers several days of \"float\" - it takes several days _ a check is cashed and funds are _ from the issuer's account, which means that the writer of the check can cam interest on the funds in the meantime. _ electronic payments are immediate, they eliminate the float for the consumer. Fourth, electronic means of payment may _ security and privacy concerns. We often hear media reports that an unauthorized hacker has been able to access a computer database and to alter information _ there. The fact that this is not an _ occurrence means that dishonest persons might be able to access bank accounts in electronic payments systems and _ from someone else's accounts. The _ of this type of fraud is no easy task, and a new field of computer science is developing to _ security issues. A further concern is that the use of electronic means of payment leaves an electronic _ that contains a large amount of personal data. There are concerns that government, employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby violating our privacy.", "options": [["However", "Moreover", "Therefore", "Otherwise"], ["off", "back", "over", "around"], ["power", "concept", "history", "role"], ["reward", "resist", "resume", "reverse"], ["silent", "sudden", "slow", "steady"], ["for", "against", "with", "on"], ["imaginative", "expensive", "sensitive", "productive"], ["similar", "original", "temporary", "dominant"], ["collect", "provide", "copy", "print"], ["give up", "take over", "bring back", "pass down"], ["before", "after", "since", "when"], ["kept", "borrowed", "released", "withdrawn"], ["Unless", "Until", "Because", "Though"], ["hide", "express", "raise", "ease"], ["analyzed", "shared", "stored", "displayed"], ["unsafe", "unnatural", "uncommon", "unclear"], ["steal", "choose", "benefit", "return"], ["consideration", "prevention", "manipulation", "justification"], ["cope with", "fight against", "adapt to", "call for"], ["chunk", "chip", "path", "trail"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "B", "D", "C", "B", "B", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D", "C", "C", "C", "C", "A", "B", "A", "D"]}
