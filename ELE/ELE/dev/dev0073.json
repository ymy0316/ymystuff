That's how Devon Toomey felt in 2013 when she _ a photograph on a website for an international adoption agency. Toomey had been on the site many times and seen _ many kids, but she'd never determined to email the agency about anyone _ she saw one baby born without arms and legs. \" _ seeing him, I just knew he was our child. There was just something that spoke to me,\" she says. Today, four years later, that boy, named Bowen Toomey, is a 5-year-old _ with two older brothers living in Eagle, Idaho. He is _ on going to school, jumping on trampolines , reading books and _ himself to difficult tasks. But his _ disability means he can't live _ like others: Where other children use their _ to handle things, Bowen sometimes uses his mouth or a special band he wears that lets him _ things like a spoon. \"He does everything any other kids do: he just finds his way to _ various problems. He can ride his skate already,\" his mother says. \"He _ loves to swim, and can dive and swim independently. I think he loves it so much _ the water is the place where he really doesn't have limitations.\" A former special education teacher, Toomey and her husband, Jeremy, knew they wanted to adopt. Nine months after she _ Bowen on the website of a Serbian orphanage , _ in Belgrade, the entire family went there to take home their 18-month-old addition. Although Bowen had been well taken care of at the orphanage, he didn't get much attention, and for the most part he was just laid in the bed. The young boy _ to his new family in a way _ he surprised everyone. \"We laid eyes on him and from that moment on, he _ joyful, which really touched our hearts,\" she says, \"I said to myself, _ is no wonder that I wanted him the moment I saw him'. He is my child.\"", "options": [["took on", "handed in", "made up", "came across"], ["such", "so", "what", "how"], ["until", "since", "unless", "after"], ["At", "In", "On", "With"], ["companion", "kindergartner", "orphan", "adolescent"], ["keen", "fond", "interested", "addicted"], ["applying", "absorbing", "focusing", "owing"], ["mental", "spiritual", "psychological", "physical"], ["happily", "normally", "usually", "commonly"], ["bodies", "feet", "hands", "heads"], ["cope with", "deal in", "take down", "serve as"], ["develop", "meet", "address", "accept"], ["previously", "particularly", "purposely", "eventually"], ["so that", "besides that", "in that", "for that"], ["looked", "recognized", "asked", "discovered"], ["locating", "is locating", "is located", "located"], ["turned", "returned", "responded", "replied"], ["how", "that", "where", "which"], ["became", "has become", "had become", "becomes"], ["There", "That", "This", "It"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "A", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "C", "B", "C", "D", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D"]}
