{"article": ", \"Nature and Nurture\" People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behavior are formed. However, it is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another _ . Social scientists are of course _ interested in these types of questions. They want to explain why we possess certain _ and exhibit certain behavior. There are no clear answers yet, but two _ schools of thought on the matter have developed. _ one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other, and there is a great deal of debate between _ of each theory. The controversy is often referred to as nature and nurture . Those who _ the nature\" side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are _ determined by biological factors. That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is _ to this theory. Taken to an extreme, this theory states that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our _ . Supporters of the nurture theory, or, as they are often called, _ , claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instinctsin determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely _ by their surroundings. The behaviorists' view of the human being is quite mechanistic . They state that, like machines, humans respond to _ stimuli as the basis of their behavior. Socially and politically, the results of these two theories are _ . In the US, for example, blacks often score below whites on intelligence tests. This leads some nature supporters to conclude that blacks are genetically _ in status than whites are. Behaviorists, _ , say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often robbed of many of the educational and other environmental _ that whites enjoy, and that, as a result, they do not develop the same _ that whites do. Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. As a matter of fact, it is quite _ that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes and that the debate will _ for a long time is certain.", "options": [["sensitive", "productive", "competitive", "impressive"], ["frequently", "extremely", "generally", "occasionally"], ["approaches", "possessions", "characteristics", "friends"], ["different", "reliable", "excellent", "equal"], ["What", "As", "Which", "That"], ["objectors", "operators", "opponents", "supporters"], ["claim", "support", "resolve", "object"], ["completely", "largely", "thoroughly", "merely"], ["sensitive", "open", "central", "subject"], ["abilities", "teachers", "personalities", "instincts"], ["experts", "behaviorists", "environmentalists", "scientists"], ["shaped", "discussed", "constructed", "learned"], ["environmental", "biological", "psychological", "physical"], ["temporary", "slight", "fatal", "far-reaching"], ["lower", "higher", "stronger", "smarter"], ["on the contrary", "as a whole", "after all", "for instance"], ["protections", "pollutions", "technologies", "advantages"], ["conclusions", "abilities", "responses", "opportunities"], ["necessary", "impossible", "unreasonable", "likely"], ["arise", "disappear", "continue", "respond"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D", "A", "A", "D", "C", "D", "C"]}
