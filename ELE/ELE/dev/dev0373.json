Bristol PLuS aims to boost students in an increasingly _ job market by helping them acquire work and life skills alongside _ qualifications. \"Our students are a pretty active bunch, but we found that they didn't _ appreciate the value of what they did _ the lecture hall,\" says Jeff Goodman, director of careers and employability at the university. \"Employers are much more _ than they used to be. They used to look for _ and saw it as part of their job to extract the value of an applicant's skills. Now they want students to be able to explain why those skills are _ to the job.\" Students who sign _ for the award will be expected to complete 50 hours of work experience or _ work, attend four workshops on employ-ability skills, take part in an intensive skills-related activity _ , crucially, write a summary of the skills they have gained. _ efforts will gain an Outstanding Achievement Award. Those who _ best on the sports field can take the Sporting PLuS Award which fosters employer-friendly sports accomplishments.
