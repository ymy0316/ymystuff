{"article": "Most people who travel from China to the US find that, despite having studied English for years, they have to \"re-learn\" it _ arriving. Words that we learned in English classes are not _ the same way here. To truly be part of the \"meltingpot\", _ in English is not enough. You need an accent to stand out. When I first came to the US for graduate school, I was a _ foreigner. I felt so out of place that I wantedto hide everything about me that was \" _ \". To talk like an American became one of my goals. During my first term as a teaching assistant (TA), my students _ they could not understand me. I learnedlater from a study that this complaint was _ among US students with an international TA. It is called the \"Oh,no!\" syndrome :\"Oh, no! Not another international TA, and not that _ again!\" So I imitated the way _ speakers talk and, over time, I made _ good progress that American friends started to _ my English as having \"almost no accent\". I took this as a sign of my success. Ever since,people have often _ me for someone from many _ : the Midwest, the West Coast, China, Japan, South Korea.Most frequently, people think I am from California. But then suddenly, conformity was _ a praise: If I talk like an American, am I still Chinese? If I losemy Chinese accent, do I also lose my cultural identity? Am I denying my past by being _ into a new culture? Now I _ that a person\"s accent is a permanent record of their past cultural experience and it is a _ of one\"sexposure to diverse cultures. As a fourth-year student in the US, I am no longer a nervous foreigner. My nervousness has been _ by a desire to hold on to my cultural _ . Now I consciously add some Chinese \"accent\" when I speak. I do not wish to speak \" _ \" English because I am proud of who I am.", "options": [["before", "if", "from", "upon"], ["put", "pronounced", "used", "understood"], ["fluency", "sense", "quality", "interest"], ["nervous", "stupid", "strange", "curious"], ["valuable", "different", "dangerous", "foolish"], ["complained", "whispered", "told", "informed"], ["interesting", "rare", "common", "special"], ["accent", "trouble", "Chinese", "English"], ["other", "native", "popular", "famous"], ["so", "such", "much", "many"], ["praise", "encourage", "criticize", "teach"], ["regarded", "mistaken", "treated", "thought"], ["countries", "cities", "states", "places"], ["more than", "no longer", "nothing but", "not as important as"], ["melted", "joined", "absorbed", "connected"], ["doubt", "regret", "notice", "realize"], ["mark", "way", "fact", "matter"], ["changed", "dropped", "replaced", "taken"], ["origins", "beliefs", "knowledge", "understanding"], ["poor", "Chinese", "perfect", "British"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "A", "A", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B", "B", "A", "B", "D", "B", "C", "D", "A", "C", "A", "C"]}
