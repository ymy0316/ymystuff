{"article": "The first time I (Jimmy Carter) fully realized how much our lives had changed was when I approached my seventieth birthday. In one of her hour-long special _ Barbara Waiters spoke with me about things I had done. She covered all the _ of my life, from the farm to submarines, and from business to the governor\"s mansion. Most of all, she asked me about my life of _ in the White House as president and my return home. Then she asked me a question that _ some serious thought. \"Mr. President,\" she said, \"you have had a number of exciting and challenging _ . What have been your best years?\" After a few moments I responded with _ certainty:\"Now is the best time of all.\" She was _ and asked, \"Why?\" I fumbled with some thoughts about time. I also said something about spending more time with my family, and finding time to _ some of my former errors. Afterward I realized how _ my glib answer had been. Then I discussed with Rosalynn how _ different-and pleasant-was the reality of our senior years. This book is my expanded attempt, _ on our personal experience, to answer that question. I described, _ , the virtues of aging. This is, after all, the name of the book: The Virtues of Aging. We are not _ in our worry about the physical aspects of aging. Neither are we by ourselves in the prejudice that _ toward the elderly. It is similar to racism or sexism. _ makes it different is that the prejudice also exists among those of us who are either within this group or rapidly approaching it. When I _ the title of this book to a few people, most of them responded with the same answer. \" _ ?\" they asked. \"What could possibly be good about _ old?\" The most _ answer, of course, is to consider the alternative to aging. But there are _ of other good answers. Many of them included in this book are based on our personal experiences and observations.", "options": [["reports", "questions", "interviews", "speeches"], ["aspects", "ways", "styles", "patterns"], ["study", "position", "occupation", "service"], ["enquired", "required", "inquired", "acquired"], ["careers", "employments", "pursuits", "businesses"], ["abundant", "absolute", "absent", "abrupt"], ["joyful", "pleased", "surprised", "delighted"], ["reform", "adjust", "correct", "right"], ["inconvenient", "inefficient", "ineffective", "inadequate"], ["deeply", "completely", "firmly", "strongly"], ["based", "established", "supported", "centered"], ["in consequence", "I in result", "in response", "in fact"], ["single handed", "alone", "unaided", "lonely"], ["resists", "consists", "exists", "assists"], ["What", "It", "That", "Which"], ["referred", "mentioned", "indicated", "pronounced"], ["Virtues", "Qualities", "Advantages", "Values"], ["keeping", "going", "growing", "coming"], ["reliable", "easy", "obvious", "correct"], ["plenty", "abundance", "load", "sufficient"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "D", "B", "A", "B", "C", "C", "D", "B", "A", "D", "B", "C", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C", "A"]}
