Simply _ , anyone who is adventurous, loves traveling to Europe and is fit enough to do 10-mile hikes should seriously consider doing this hike. Before this experience, I had never heard about On Foot Holidays programs that allow hikers to go at their own pace, with maps and detailed hiking _ , but without a guide or other travelers, while still enjoying a high level of local support. What _ caught my attention was an announcement about On Foot Holidays' newest hike, the Lighthouse Way, which they described as a journey along\" the last _ coast of Europe.\" This particular hike sounded both challenging and rewarding enough to _ a try.
