{"article": "Kids who live a happy childhood dream about what they will be when they grow up. But less _ kids, who live in poverty, sometimes wonder why they were born in the first place. Children like these _ Lebanese director Nadine Labaki's new film Capernau , which arrived in Chinese mainland _ on April 29 , 2019. In the slums of Beirut, Lebanon's capital, Labaki saw kids selling gum or flowers or _ carrying heavy gas tanks. Some of them were alone on the street, unfed and _ . One of these kids told her, \"I don't know _ I was born if no one is going to love me, if no one is going to _ me before I go to sleep, or if I'm going to be beaten up every day.\" This is how Capernaum begins: A 12-year-old boy named Zain who lives in one of Beirut's slums, charges his parents for giving _ to him, even though, he says, they knew they couldn't _ him. Capernaum is fictional but ifs as _ as it gets. There are no _ actors in this film. Zain, for example, is _ by a boy with the same name, a Syrian refugee called Zain Al Rafeea. He had never slept in a _ before the film, or gone to school. He didn't even have papers to _ he was a human being just like his character in the film. By making the film, Labaki wanted to \"become the voice of these kids\", according to The Guardian. The voice is being heard. It ran first at Cannes Film Festival in May, 2018, and _ the Jury Prize. Soon after the festival, under the _ of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Zain and his family got the chance to resettle in Norway. They now live in a house by the sea, and Zain is going to school. When Labaki told The New York Times that she wanted the film \"to go beyond the borders of just being a film\" and be \"a _ for help\", she wasn't _ how big an impact it would have. \"I might never get anywhere, but _ I want to try,\" she said. But she has certainly gone somewhere indeed to say the least, the real-life Zain is now able to _ his future.", "options": [["fortunate", "optimistic", "attractive", "desperate"], ["urged", "produced", "watched", "inspired"], ["audiences", "cinemas", "houses", "hearts"], ["ever", "more", "even", "otherwise"], ["ashamed", "violent", "hopeless", "independent"], ["why", "how", "where", "whether"], ["help", "call", "guide", "kiss"], ["poorness", "birth", "pressure", "unhappiness"], ["put up with", "care for", "look on", "pay attention to"], ["beneficial", "interesting", "true", "simple"], ["typical", "proper", "ambitious", "professional"], ["played", "moved", "encouraged", "selected"], ["bed", "village", "street", "tent"], ["write", "witness", "argue", "prove"], ["expected", "won", "deserved", "shared"], ["desire", "control", "support", "agreement"], ["sign", "love", "promise", "cry"], ["concerned", "sure", "aware", "doubtful"], ["at least", "now and then", "on the whole", "all in all"], ["decide on", "go through", "dream about", "keep up"]], "answers": ["A", "D", "B", "C", "C", "A", "D", "B", "B", "C", "D", "A", "A", "D", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "C"]}
