The driver and I were in an air-conditioned ambulance behind nearly one hundred athletes _ to hear the sharp crack of the starting gun. We re supposed to stay behind the _ runner, so take it slowly , I said to the driver , Doug , as we began to creep forward . Let s just hope all the runners are fast! he laughed.As they began to pace themselves, the front runners started to _ . It was then that my _ were drawn to the woman in blue silk running shorts and a baggy white T-shirt. Doug, look! We knew we were already watching our last runner . Her feet were turned in, but her left knee was turned out. Her legs were so crippled and bent that it seemed impossible for her to be able to walk , let alone run a marathon . Doug and I watched in _ as she slowly moved forward. We didn t say a thing. We would move forward a little bit, then stop and wait for her to gain some distance. Then we d slowly move forward a little bit more.Finally, she was the _ runner left in sight. Tears streamed down my face as I sat on the edge of my seat and watched with amazement and even respect as she _ forward with strong determination through the last miles.When the _ line came into sight, rubbishes lay everywhere and the cheering crowds had already gone home. _ , a man waited proudly there. He was _ one end of a ribbon tied to a post. _ slowly crossed through, leaving both ends of the ribbon fluttering behind her.I do not know this woman s name, but that day she became a part of my life a part I often depend on.
