Their laughter and _ arguments must have reminded Papa of the past days when my brother and I were just their _ because I saw a twinkle in his 80-year-old eyes. Hanging the _ decorations on Papa's tree, I couldn't help gently touching the very oldest of the glass balls. Those I made sure to _ from the uppermost branches, safely out of reach of tiny hands. When the tree was beautifully dressed and glowing, we bid my dad goodbye with lots of hugs and kisses and _ for home. Later that night, in the quiet darkness, I pulled my _ up close and lay down to rest and remember. The Christmas I turned 16, while decorating the tree with Mama, I _ dropped and broke a decoration.
