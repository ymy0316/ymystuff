{"article": "For years there have been endless articles _ that scientists are on the verge of _ artificial intelligence, that it is just around the corner. The truth is that it may be just around the corner, but they _ the right block yet. Artificial intelligence _ to build machines that can think. One immediate problem is to define thought, which is _ than you might think. The specialists in the _ of artificial intelligence complain with some justification , that anything that their machines do is dismissed as not _ . For example, computers can now play very, very good chess. They can't beat the greatest players in the world, but they can beat just about _ else. If a human being played chess at this level, he or she would certainly be considered smart. Why not a machine? The answer is that the machine doesn't do anything clever in playing chess. It uses its blinding speed to do a brute - force search of all _ moves for several moves ahead, evaluates the outcomes and picks the best Humans don't play chess that way. They see patterns, _ computers don't. This wooden _ to thought characterizes machine intelligence. Computers have no judgment, no flexibility, no common sense. So - called expert systems, one of the hottest areas in artificial intelligence, aim to mimic the reasoning processes of human experts in a limited field, such _ medical diagnosis or weather forecasting. There may be limited _ applications for this sort of thing, but there is no way _ a machine that can think about anything _ the sun. The hallmark of artificial intelligence to date is that if a problem is severely restricted, a machine can achieve limited success. But when the problem is _ to a realistic one, computers fall flat _ the screens. For example, machines can understand a few words _ individually by a speaker that they have been trained to hear. They cannot understand _ speech using an unlimited vocabulary spoken by just _ speaker.", "options": [["having stated", "stated", "stating", "being stated"], ["achieving", "setting", "arriving", "instructing"], ["hadn't found", "haven't found", "didn't find", "haven't been found"], ["leads", "aims", "acts", "allows"], ["easier", "more profitable", "more suitable", "harder"], ["field", "way", "level", "kind"], ["having thought", "to be thought", "being thought", "thinking"], ["everybody", "everyone", "anything", "anybody"], ["available", "possible", "adaptable", "positive"], ["that", "which", "what", "since"], ["approach", "method", "means", "key"], ["like", "for", "as", "that"], ["comfortable", "convincing", "competitive", "commercial"], ["to make", "in making", "to be made", "on making"], ["restricted", "realized", "concerned", "retained"], ["extended", "exceeded", "expanded", "extracted"], ["in", "on", "with", "at"], ["being spoken", "to be spoken", "spoken", "speaking"], ["continual", "continuous", "convenient", "gradual"], ["some", "a", "any", "all"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "B", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D", "B", "B", "A", "C", "D", "A", "A", "C", "B", "C", "B", "C"]}
