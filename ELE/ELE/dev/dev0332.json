That was three inches higher than his personal best. Michael Stone faced the most _ day of his pole-vaulting career. You couldn't tell whether Michael Stone was surprised, excited or vain about clearing the bar at 17 feet.

When Michael _ the bar at 17 feet 2 inches and 17 feet 4 inches, again he showed no _ . At the same time, he _ the people sigh, he knew the other vaulter had missed his final jump. He knew it was time for his _ jump. Since the other vaulter had fewer misses, Michael needed to clear this vault to win. A _ would get him second place. It was nothing to be ashamed of, _ Michael would not _ himself to have the thought of not winning first place.
