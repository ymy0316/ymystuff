{"article": "The Ministry of Education has spared no efforts to bring on IT learning. What is its main aim? Is it to teach students how to learn the computer or is it meant to change the usual method of teaching in order to _ students' strong interest in computers?  Teaching students computer knowledge and skills is different _ giving class lessons through the use of computers. And schools are beginning to pay much attention to using computers to teach students. There is no doubt about the fact that IT learning plays an important role as a new teaching tool in this day of technology. _ , views differ on whether the schools can achieve their targets, as success depends on whether they can make use of computers effectively.
