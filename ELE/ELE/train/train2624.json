Brent Loken, who runs a group called Integrated Conservation, used camera traps to research into orangutans. That group protects _ animals in Borneo, the largest island in Asia. Camera traps work by taking a quick photo, when something moves in front of them. In Borneo, scientists use the photos to _ what the rare orangutans do when people aren't _ ? Scientists have been studying orangutans in the rainforests for decades. And their data had suggested that the animals almost always traveled through the _ . They were _ seen walking on the forest floor. Yet when Loken looked at the photos from his team's camera traps, he got surprised that the apes were walking on the ground, _ using logging roads and paths built by people.

But it does suggest there might be ways to log forests in a way that won't greatly _ these apes. Stephanie Spehar, primatologist at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, agrees. The new study doesn't mean they're fine in areas with no trees, she says.
