One day at daycare, I _ an extremely tired mother attempt to pick up her daughter. The little girl asked her mother to have dinner in McDonald's, but the mother replied, \"Honey, not tonight. Mom has to go home and cook dinner for Daddy.\" \"But I wanna go.\" \"Susie, I said not tonight...\" Susie immediately dropped to the floor , kicking and screaming, \"I want to go to McDonald's.\" Her mother tried to stop Susie's tantrum , but in vain . Finally her mother  gave in , \"Okay, Susie, let's go to McDonald's.\" Susie stopped yelling and _ . I was amazed; and at the same time, I was _ that anything I wanted could be got in this way.

I asked, \"Mama, can I have that telephone?\" \"Baby, not now, but if you are a good girl, maybe Father Christmas will bring it to you.\" \"But Mama, I want it right now.\" Her eyes _ and her hand tightened on mine. \"Becky, you can not have that telephone today, but if you misbehave, you can have a spanking .\"  By now we were standing in the long Holiday line in the Gift Department, and I _ it was now or never. I lay down on the ground and began screaming, \"I want that telephone,\" over and over again.

She stood. The others waiting in line began to clap, and then, laughed, patting my mother.
