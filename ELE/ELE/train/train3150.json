A friend of mine once told me of _ along a one-lane, unpaved-mountain road. _ was another car that produced clouds of choking _ , and it was a long way to the nearest _ highway. Suddenly, at a _ place, the car ahead pulled off the road. _ that its owner might have engine trouble, my friend stopped and asked if anything was wrong. _ , said the other driver. But you ve endured my dust this far; I ll _ with yours the rest of the way.Another element of courtesy is empathy, a _ that enables a person to see into the mind or heart of someone else, to understand the pain or _ there and to do something to minimize it. A man _ alone in a restaurant was trying to unscrew the cap of a beer bottle, _ he couldn t do it because of badly injured _ . He asked a young boy to help him. The boy took the bottle, turned his back _ and loosened the cap without difficulty. Then he _ it again. Turning back to the man, he _ to make great efforts to open the bottle without success. _ he took it into the kitchen and returned shortly, saying that he had managed to loosen it but only with a pair of pliers.Yet another component of politeness is the ability to treat all people _ , regardless of all status or importance. _ when you have doubts about some people, act as if they are worthy of your best manners.
