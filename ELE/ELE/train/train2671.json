{"article": "Discussing the causes of animal endangerment, it's important to understand individual species are not the only factors. Endangerment is a broad _ , one that involves the habitats and environments. Although some measures are being taken to help specific cases of endangerment, the universal problem cannot be solved until humans _ the natural environments. There are many reasons why a particular species may become endangered, but habitat destruction is on top. Our planet is changing, causing habitats to be modified. Natural changes tend to occur at a _ pace, usually causing only a slight _ on individual species. However, when changes occur at a fast pace, there is little or no time for individual species to _ and adjust to new circumstances, which can create terrible results. For this reason, rapid habitat loss is the primary cause of species endangerment. The strongest _ in rapid habitat loss are human beings. Nearly every region of the earth has been affected by human activity. The loss of microbes in soils that _ supported tropical forests, the _ of f various fishes in polluted habitats, and changes in global climate caused by the _ of greenhouse gases are all results of human activity. It can be difficult for an individual to _ the effects humans have had on specific species. But it is quite _ that human activity has greatly _ to species endangerment. For example , although tropical forests may look as if they were thick and healthy, they are _ highly susceptible to destruction because the soils in which they grow _ nutrients. If the current rate of forest loss continues, huge quantities of plant and animal species will disappear.", "options": [["theme", "project", "issue", "experiment"], ["worsen", "protect", "construct", "ignore"], ["gradual", "single", "stable", "rapid"], ["anxiety", "improvement", "impact", "burden"], ["survive", "react", "reflect", "live"], ["ruins", "objections", "limitations", "forces"], ["formerly", "formally", "freely", "usually"], ["appreciation", "destruction", "extinction", "existence"], ["escape", "leak", "release", "relief"], ["cause", "remind", "remember", "recognize"], ["reasonable", "obvious", "possible", "natural"], ["devoted", "donated", "contributed", "adapted"], ["naturally", "actually", "fully", "completely"], ["lack", "contain", "reduce", "limit"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "C", "D", "B", "C", "B", "A"]}
