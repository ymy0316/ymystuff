{"article": "According to Greek legend, in ancient Athens a man noticed the great storyteller Aesop playing childish games with some little boys. He _ and made fun of Aesop, asking him why he wasted his time in such _ games. Aesop responded by picking up a bow, loosening its string, and placing it on the ground. Then he said to the critical man, \"Now, _ the riddle , if you can. Tell us what the unstrung bow means.\" The man _ at it for several minutes but had no idea about what _ Aesop was trying to make. Aesop _ ,\"If you keep a bow always bent, it will break _ ; but if you let it go loose, it will be more _ for use when you want it.\" So it is with us. Our minds and bodies are like the _ .When often under the _ of everyday life, we can finally _ .We need to loosen up; we need time to _ the pressure off and relax. Former baseball pitcher Dutch Leonard might have put it a little differently. He once said that the _ of great pitching is not speed or the ability to throw curves . It's the \"change of pace\". Even the _ batter will soon learn how to hit a pitcher who continually throws the same kind of pitch. But it's _ to hit a pitcher who changes the pace of pitching. That _ of pace gives a pitcher an advantage over the other pitchers. A change of pace also gives us a(n) _ in life. Taking time to watch the clouds, enjoy a breeze, take a walk, read just slowdown is _ if we are to be our best later. And a regular day of rest is as important as regular sleep. It's a _ of taking the pressure off. To be your best, make sure you change your pace. It may just be the change you need.", "options": [["wondered", "laughed", "shouted", "cried"], ["wise", "bright", "foolish", "false"], ["make", "answer", "follow", "ask"], ["stopped", "aimed", "smiled", "looked"], ["point", "legend", "idea", "plan"], ["answered", "replied", "explained", "called"], ["finally", "certainly", "firstly", "generally"], ["possible", "careful", "hopeful", "fit"], ["string", "bow", "riddle", "activity"], ["routine", "control", "pressure", "pain"], ["fall", "break", "die", "pass"], ["put", "catch", "give", "take"], ["secret", "solution", "ability", "method"], ["great", "successful", "average", "smart"], ["easy", "hard", "likely", "usual"], ["kind", "game", "change", "speed"], ["advantage", "road", "bottom", "center"], ["convenient", "necessary", "acceptable", "reasonable"], ["trick", "result", "beginning", "way"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "D", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D"]}
