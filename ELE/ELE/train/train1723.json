{"article": "20 June 2013 Ankara, Turkey: I come from Moldova and I am now working as a UN Volunteer with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Turkey. I have been living in Turkey for a few years and have had the _ to observe the approach of the Turkish people towards _ . In Turkey people help each other with their hearts and from their hearts on a continuous basis. Young people are the main driving engine behind the ever-growing volunteer force in Turkey.

This trend grew _ in the late 1990s, despite the fact that civil society organizations have sometimes been viewed with disbelief by some state authorities.

Especially according to recent events in neighboring countries, and given the arrival of refugees and the increased time necessary to process the _ number of applications for shelter, the contribution of UN Volunteers to UNHCR seems necessary and the impact invaluable. I also believe that I have brought cultural diversity to an already diverse _ , where true professionals and young graduates from different nations work hard side by side to _ refugees and find durable solutions for them.", "options": [["ability", "opportunity", "description", "permission"], ["volunteerism", "charity", "poverty", "colleague"], ["starving", "primitive", "young", "crowded"], ["particularly", "remotely", "politically", "mysteriously"], ["expanded", "added", "prohibited", "changed"], ["congratulating", "contributing", "retelling", "accustoming"], ["permission", "achievement", "celebration", "reception"], ["worthwhile", "additional", "alternative", "vacant"], ["falling", "decreasing", "heating", "rising"], ["tribe", "office", "staff", "government"], ["protect", "drive", "obtain", "contain"]], "answers": ["B", "A", "C", "A", "D", "B", "B", "A", "D", "B", "A"]}
