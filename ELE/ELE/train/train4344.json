The washing machine sounded as my husband walked in with our daughters. We had only about twenty minutes to eat _ we had to take the girls to their next activity. My husband seemed a bit _ that dinner was not on the table. That night, I had a heavy _ , thinking we were becoming taskmasters on an assembly line . We had become too _ in our own tasks and not very considerate towards those around us. We needed to do something to bring back some meaning into our lives.

So, when someone does return the favor, it is an enormous and _ bonus.", "options": [["though", "unless", "before", "while"], ["annoyed", "puzzled", "embarrassed", "frightened"], ["shoulder", "stomach", "foot", "heart"], ["absorbed", "interested", "confident", "successful"], ["repeat", "relate", "refocus", "recall"], ["kindness", "task", "job", "copy"], ["room", "home", "school", "town"], ["stranger", "sweeter", "harder", "bigger"], ["beyond", "from", "about", "between"], ["matter", "count", "last", "happen"], ["time", "life", "start", "idea"], ["praise", "check", "record", "do"], ["describe", "decide", "remember", "explain"], ["bring", "teach", "offer", "tell"], ["effort", "choice", "difference", "fortune"], ["forgetting", "believing", "knowing", "wondering"], ["tiring", "moving", "surprising", "rewarding"], ["experience", "imagine", "predict", "exchange"], ["silence", "return", "time", "order"], ["negative", "positive", "slight", "threatening"]], "answers": ["C", "A", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "D", "B", "D", "C", "D", "D", "A", "B", "B"]}
