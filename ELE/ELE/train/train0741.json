{"article": "Cloze Much time and effort has been devoted to researching the mental health benefits of flexible work environments, but can the ability to leave work early to watch your son's soccer game, or arrive at the office a bit later in the morning in order to see to some personal matters, have broader physical health benefits _ making you feel a bit less tired? According to new research published in the Cochrane Library's Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, it seems so. In a review of 10 previous studies examining the health effects of flexible work conditions for more than 16,000 people, _ from the U.K.'s Durham University and University of Newcastle, as well as the University of Montreal, found that flexible work schedules -- when employees can _ their starting times, for example -- were associated with improvements in a person's overall health. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, in all of the studies included in the review, researchers found no evidence for _ effects of more flexible work schedules. This initial analysis was intended to throw light on the potential health benefits of flexible work options, which are increasingly _ throughout Scandinavia, and have recently gained some ground in the U.K. For example , last April, the British government _ a policy that allowed parents of children ages six and under to request flexible work arrangements to include parents of children ages 16 and younger. In the U.S., the phenomenon is a bit slower to catch on. Yet, the economic slowdown of recent years may have contributed to _ in workplace flexibility -- as companies _ to reward employees with bonuses or raises may turn to other forms of compensation , Reuters reported early last year. Previous research too, of course, has indicated the benefits of flexible work environments toward positive mental health outcomes. And while these latest findings are promising, the researchers stress that more study is vital to understanding the detailed _ between flexible work and improved health outcomes. To truly _ the benefits of flexible working conditions, the researchers say, additional study analyzing health outcomes among a wide _ of workers -- from high-ranking executives to hourly employees -- is _ , which helps to gain a deeper understanding of the issue, and to shape future workplace policy.", "options": [["across", "besides", "before", "over"], ["officials", "employers", "executives", "researchers"], ["spend", "devote", "shift", "cancel"], ["changeable", "positive", "considerable", "negative"], ["popular", "interesting", "adaptable", "multiple"], ["extended", "adopted", "made", "implemented"], ["decrease", "beginning", "freedom", "growth"], ["willing", "unable", "determined", "ready"], ["difference", "relationship", "progress", "movement"], ["grasp", "follow", "fight", "apply"], ["variety", "change", "range", "gap"], ["critical", "possible", "feasible", "demanding"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "C", "D", "A", "A", "D", "B", "B", "A", "C", "A"]}
