He sat down at the table to my right and then _ his large dirty paper bag of clothing down on the floor. Obviously, this man was homeless and _ a bath. He picked up the one small slice of pizza and very slowly, very carefully, he began to eat, taking very little _ . He finally finished his meal and did something that I would never _ . He turned the box on its corner and slid the few _ bits into one corner. Then he _ his index finger and tried to pick up the small bits. Oh, how much it hurt me once again to see myself _ I was thirty years ago. No food, no _ , and no clean clothes. Most of my past life had always been _ to that of the young man and it all came back to me _ . The muscles in my neck began to tighten and my eyes began to burn and water up. I coughed a bit, trying to clear my _ and get myself back together. I got four large slices of pizza from the counter and sat them down on his table, saying, I thought you _ like to have a few slices. I did not stop at all but walked around behind him. As I passed him, I reached out and _ him on the back, just one time, very softly with my hand. I hope that man knows that someone, someplace, _ him as a human being. And I am so _ that I have never forgotten what it feels like to be down, out, dirty and hungry.", "options": [["crashed", "hid", "laid", "replaced"], ["in fear of", "in support of", "in search of", "in need of"], ["bites", "blocks", "rolls", "sheets"], ["believe", "forget", "forgive", "prevent"], ["filling", "matching", "remaining", "rewarding"], ["cool", "warm", "dry", "wet"], ["as", "after", "since", "before"], ["belief", "baggage", "shelter", "respect"], ["contrary", "familiar", "similar", "equal"], ["swiftly", "gently", "properly", "regularly"], ["neck", "throat", "eyes", "hands"], ["should", "must", "shall", "might"], ["hit", "patted", "rubbed", "shook"], ["cares about", "thinks highly of", "relies on", "watches out for"], ["curious", "puzzled", "shocked", "grateful"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "C", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "D"]}
