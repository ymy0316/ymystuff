{"article": "I was walking around in a Big Bazar store doing a shopping, when I saw a Cashier talking to a boy who couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old. The Cashier said, \"I'm sorry, _ you don't have enough money to buy this doll.\" Then the little boy turned to me and asked, \"Uncle, are you sure I don't have enough money?\" I _ his cash and replied, \"You know that you don't have enough money to buy the doll, my dear.\" The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I walked _ him and I asked him _ he wished to give this doll to. \"It's the doll _ my sister loved most and wanted so much. I wanted to gift her for her Birthday. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.\" His eyes were so _ while saying this. \"My Sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.\" My heart _ stopped. The little boy _ me and said, \"I told daddy to tell mommy not to go _ . I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.\" Then he looked again at the _ with sad eyes, very quietly. I quickly _ for my wallet and said to the boy. \"Suppose we check again, just _ you do have enough money for the doll?\" I added some of my money to his, without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some _ money. The little boy said, \"Thank you God for giving me enough money! I asked last night God to _ I had enough money to buy this doll. He heard me! I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't _ to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose. \" I finished my shopping in a totally different _ from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local newspaper article two days ago, which mentioned a _ man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a _ state. The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is _ , to this day, hard to imagine. And in a _ of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him.", "options": [["and", "because", "but", "so"], ["paid", "charged", "exchanged", "counted"], ["up", "toward", "with", "at"], ["who", "which", "why", "when"], ["which", "what", "that", "where"], ["excited", "sad", "scared", "wet"], ["hardly", "approximately", "suddenly", "nearly"], ["look up", "look upon as", "look upon", "look up at"], ["yet", "but", "however", "so"], ["money", "me", "doll", "rose"], ["got", "reached", "took", "brought"], ["in case", "as a result", "despite", "in terms of"], ["spare", "pocket", "available", "vacant"], ["make up", "make for", "make sure", "make out"], ["care", "dare", "fare", "pare"], ["stage", "way", "position", "state"], ["drunk", "timid", "careless", "unknown"], ["criticism", "critic", "critical", "criticize"], ["always", "therefore", "often", "still"], ["section", "fraction", "position", "imagination"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "B", "A", "C", "B", "D", "D", "A", "C", "B", "A", "A", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D", "B"]}
