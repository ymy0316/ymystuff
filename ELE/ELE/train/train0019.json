Plus, they probably think to themselves that it's perfectly okay to fall down, and that it's not _ to do so. In other words, they give themselves _ to make mistakes, subconsciously. While I was _ by the boy's persistence, I was equally touched by the _ in which he ran. With each attempt, he looked so confident so natural. His only aim was to run freely and to do it as effectively as he could. He was just being a child just being himself being completely in the moment.
