In 2005, it was at a big cancer center where I was working _ I received the news that my mother had breast cancer. And then five days later, I received the news that I had breast cancer. My mother and I can be competitive, but I was really not trying to _ with her on this one. I learned a lot being a patient, and one of the surprising things was that only a small part of the cancer experience is about _ .
