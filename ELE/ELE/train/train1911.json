{"article": "Almost everyone wants to get smarter. We struggle to improve our _ , intelligence and attention. We drink cup after cup of coffee to help us _ the day. _ , a new study published in Current Directions in Psychological Science warns that there are _ to how smart humans can get.

Scientists say that our thinking ability works in the same way. A baby's brain size is limited by a series of _ , such as the size of the mother's pelvis. If our brains developed to be bigger, there could be more _ during childbirth. The study of Jews, who have an average IQ much _ than other Europeans, showed they were more _ to develop diseases of the _ system. This might be because of their increased brainpower.
