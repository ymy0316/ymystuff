As is said, The best house is in America, the best wife is in Japan, and the best food is in China. So I _ pride and pleasure to _ the best food for my American family. Each day, regardless of my poor skill of cooking, I would do something in a _ way: changing the dishes color, the meat's type or the soup's style. Thus, my American friends could discover the _ of eating Chinese food. Because of my _ job, I was often rewarded by their _ of thanks such as very delicious , excellent , etc. _ something funny happened yesterday when I cooked Sichuan style fish for dinner. I was _ with my work. When the whole family sat round the table, they first looked _ at the fish, then looked at me. Why do all the fish have their _ they asked It's terrible! _ or terrible I can't understand. But I do know that fish heads are delicious. The head is the _ part of fish; in _ only the important guest can have the _ of enjoying it. Another _ thing is: the American friends often said to me _ as they _ home fruits or other things. According to Chinese tradition I would simply smile in answer to their kindness _ actually helping myself to any of the food. _ , I said help yourself to them whenever I brought home fruits. Dear me! No matter how much or how often I brought home food, as long as it was nice to their taste, they _ hesitated to use their hands to help themselves until all was finished.", "options": [["took", "shared", "held", "had"], ["leave", "fetch", "cook", "buy"], ["simple", "new", "same", "magic"], ["importance", "joy", "trouble", "way"], ["new", "daily", "good", "hard"], ["smile", "flowers", "talk", "expressions"], ["However", "But", "So", "And"], ["surprised", "pleased", "strict", "proud"], ["worriedly", "excitedly", "surprisedly", "happily"], ["heads", "skins", "tails", "bones"], ["Particular", "Wonderful", "Comfortable", "Beautiful"], ["biggest", "best", "dearest", "lightest"], ["the West", "China", "USA", "the East"], ["ability", "safety", "chance", "honor"], ["enjoyable", "exciting", "interesting", "common"], ["dear me", "excuse me", "help yourself", "enjoy yourself"], ["collected", "wanted", "bought", "brought"], ["and", "but", "without", "not"], ["In return", "Above all", "After all", "At last"], ["always", "often", "never", "usually"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "B", "C", "D", "B", "B", "C", "A", "D", "B", "B", "D", "C", "C", "D", "C", "A", "C"]}
