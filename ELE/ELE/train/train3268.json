{"article": "Do you think you have what it takes to be a successful scientist? A successful scientist is generally a good observer. He makes full _ of the facts he observes. He doesn't accept ideas which are not _ on obvious facts, and therefore _ to accept authority as the only reason for truth. He always checks ideas _ and makes experiments to prove them. The rise of _ science may perhaps be considered to _ as far back as the _ of Roger Bacon, the wonderful philosopher of Oxford, who lived _ the years 1214 and 1292. He was probably the first in the middle ages to suggest that we must learn science _ observing and experimenting on the things around us, and he himself _ many important truths. Galileo (1564 1642), however, who lived more than 300 years later, was the greatest of several great men in Italy, France, Germany, and England, _ began to show how many important _ could be discovered by observation by degrees. Before Galileo, learned men believed that large bodies fell more _ towards the earth than small ones, _ Aristotle said so. But Galileo, going to the _ of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, let fall two _ stones and proved Aristotle was wrong. It was Galileo's _ of going direct to nature, and proving our _ and theories by experiment, that has led to all the discoveries of modern science. What _ those people good scientists? From the example of Galileo, we know it clearly that successful scientists are those whose observations have _ better results.", "options": [["use", "time", "speed", "trust"], ["relied", "based", "insisted", "centered"], ["refuses", "desires", "intends", "regrets"], ["casually", "carefully", "quickly", "secretly"], ["natural", "physical", "ancient", "modern"], ["date", "keep", "look", "come"], ["study", "time", "year", "birth"], ["both", "each", "between", "among"], ["in", "with", "on", "by"], ["brought", "discovered", "took", "gave"], ["who", "when", "that", "where"], ["truths", "problems", "people", "subjects"], ["slowly", "rapidly", "lightly", "heavily"], ["although", "because", "when", "if"], ["place", "foot", "top", "ceiling"], ["big", "small", "equal", "unequal"], ["spirit", "skill", "theory", "discovery"], ["plans", "opinions", "world", "ability"], ["makes", "prevents", "considers", "promises"], ["foreseen", "rejected", "produced", "challenged"]], "answers": ["A", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A", "B", "C", "D", "B", "A", "A", "B", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "A", "C"]}
