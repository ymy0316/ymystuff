The boy in my class often _ about her and laughed their heads off. She would open a book, pretending to read, with tears dropping on the open page. All I knew was that she was an orphan from Africa. She had just been adopted by a family in town who _ that the best way for her to learn American ways of life was to be with American kids. I looked down at this _ girl and promised myself that somehow I would help her. But how could I help her _ in with us? There had to be a _ .
