{"article": "Our children grew up on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, although my husband and I sometimes sneak one late at night with a glass of milk. I believe that the success of this _ loved concoction lies not in the brand of peanut butter, but rather in the jelly. The right jelly _ the plate, and homemade is the only choice. My mother-in-law was the jelly maker in this family. This limited choice was a welcome _ in the days of toddlers, siblings and puppies. All I did was to _ baby food jars, which my mother-in-law would seal with wax and _ back home with us. _ I wanted to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , all I had to do was reach for one of little jars. Jelly making was just a way of _ for my mother-in-law. She always did it, setting the _ jelly on the shelves . My father-in-law died several years ago and this past December, she also passed away . Among the things in the house to be divided by her children were the _ canned goods. The other day I reached my pantry for jelly for a quick sandwich. Sitting all alone on the far side of the shelf was a small jar of grape jelly, whose lid was _ in places. _ on it were \"GR\" for grape and the year when the jelly was made. As I picked up the jar, I suddenly realized something that I had _ to see earlier. This was the last jar we would ever have from the _ ,loving hands .

No longer was it just a jar of jelly. It was the end of a family _ . We have hundreds of pictures and many more memories that we expect to _ the years and to pass on to our children. The jar of jelly won't keep that long.
