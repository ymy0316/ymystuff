{"article": "Whenever the bare trees and grey skies of mid-November start to get me down and I start to mope about how autumn always ends too early, I go to a special place in my mind. This place _ a beautiful memory that I cherish to this day.  It was many years ago when my _ children were still young. A warm Indian Summer had blessed us with a beautiful Wednesday. It was the _ before Thanksgiving and my wife was baking pumpkin pies to _ to her Mom s house for Thanksgiving dinner, so I _ to take the three kids to a local _ for the afternoon. Mighty Oak trees throughout the park had _ down a blanket of dry leaves on the ground. I found an old _ tree branch nearby and decided to make some good _ of it. Using it as a rake I slowly made several huge piles of _ on the side of a hill. Then I called my _ over. They knew just what to do.  The next hour was spent jumping and _ in the leaves. We took turns burying each other. We played hide and seek. We _ to be leaf monsters. And we saw who could make the biggest splash in the _ and crunchy piles. It was a magical time full of smiles, laughter, and the simple joys of childhood. After that day we made many more happy _ to the park to play in the leaves.  Happy _ of loving times are a lot like those fallen leaves in November. They nourish the soil of our souls and _ new life inside of us whenever we think of them. They give us the strength to keep on creating fresh _ and a new Springtime everyday of our lives. This Thanksgiving then gives a special Thank You to God for all of your happy memories and _ times. And also whenever you _ the chance, jump in the leaves!", "options": [["destroys", "holds", "obeys", "overlooks"], ["healthy", "perfect", "grown", "overweight"], ["week", "month", "day", "year"], ["show", "bring", "take", "lead"], ["hesitated", "doubted", "wanted", "decided"], ["school", "hospital", "office", "park"], ["laid", "lied", "lay", "passed"], ["fallen", "disabled", "puzzled", "private"], ["use", "efforts", "fuss", "point"], ["branches", "leaves", "soil", "sands"], ["pupils", "children", "fellows", "friends"], ["receiving", "picking", "burning", "playing"], ["pretended", "imagined", "accepted", "thought"], ["green", "wet", "dry", "brown"], ["records", "voyages", "trips", "routines"], ["richest", "cleverest", "worst", "memories"], ["hold up", "take up", "bring up", "bring forth"], ["air", "joy", "vegetable", "story"], ["amazing", "loving", "terrible", "frightening"], ["get", "replace", "reform", "harvest"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "C", "C", "D", "D", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "D", "A", "C", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B", "A"]}
