{"article": "Lately I've been concerned about the environment. Last weekend I participated in the great Canadian shoreline _ . On that day, my mother and I arrived at 9:30 a.m. More than fifty people _ and all the volunteers were divided into groups.

It was amazing how much we were able to _ . I couldn't believe the _ we made the shoreline looked clean! _ , we had to leave the bricks as they would have broken our garbage and recycling bags! I did find one tire but it _ so deep in the mud and dirt that I couldn't dig it out, _ with the help of one of those metal rods. _ the waste was easy; it was trying to keep a record of everything we found that was the _ part. We had a sheet with many categories of items to _ . It's great to get all _ but it wasn't much fun for the volunteer stuck _ recording all the information. Our purpose was to make the shoreline _ , not to write lines and lines of what we have discovered. We often hear some people _ about their surroundings. If you are one of them, I'd like to say the only way to change things is by _ rather than complaining. We need to teach by _ . We can't blame others _ we start with ourselves.
