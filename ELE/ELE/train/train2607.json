First the person must recognize that there is a problem.For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot ride it to class as he usually does.Sam must _ that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the person must _ the problem.Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must know why it does not work.For example, he must _ the parts that are wrong.
