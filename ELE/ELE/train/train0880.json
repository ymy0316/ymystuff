{"article": "\"Forgiveness is the sweetest revenge.\" I saw this wonderful old saying again in a book recently. It got me thinking about all the times that I have been _ to forgive others in my life and all the joy that it has brought me. One _ stands out particularly well. I was a young boy at a summer camp. I was having a great time and _ everything about it except for another young boy of my age. To say we didn't get along would be a statement that made the situation less serious than it really was. We spent most of the week irritating, insulting , and picking on each other.   _ finally came to a fight on the next to last day of camp. We got into a fist fight which I lost. _ older boys broke it up before I was hurt too much. I spent the rest of the day alone, refusing to speak and lost in my own _ . The next day my spirits were _ when Mom brought the boys in our cabin some of her delicious homemade _ . I was enjoying a few slices of it when I saw the other boy sitting by himself at the bottom of the steps outside. He seemed very _ right then. I am not sure what moved me to do so, but I took my pizza down and _ it with him. It made all the anger and pain inside me go away . We became friends after that. I never got into another fist fight either. I had found out that sharing and forgiving were much more fun and a lot less painful.  Forgiveness is _ the sweetest revenge. It can turn an enemy into a friend. It can _ a heart from the chains of anger, hatred, and pain. It can open a soul to the sweetness of love and joy once again. May your life always be _ of sweet forgiveness.", "options": [["disappointed", "satisfied", "unwilling", "able"], ["memory", "lesson", "incident", "week"], ["struggling", "exploring", "enjoying", "remembering"], ["Thoughts", "Words", "Friends", "Conflicts"], ["Surprisingly", "Thankfully", "Unexpectedly", "Regretfully"], ["fight", "regret", "luck", "anger"], ["sunk", "broken", "lifted", "shown"], ["pizza", "hamburger", "pie", "sandwich"], ["angry", "proud", "ashamed", "lonely"], ["presented", "shared", "distributed", "divided"], ["nearly", "merely", "truly", "hardly"], ["keep", "cure", "comfort", "free"], ["full", "aware", "confident", "certain"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "C", "B", "B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "C", "D", "A"]}
