I grew up in a _ , positive home environment, where there were always family _ and lots of laughter. I have fond memories of my mom taking us to _ every Saturday morning. While my brother and I would have rather stayed home on our day off from school, she had us _ her to help people in Roanoke, Virginia who needed groceries to feed their families. While she did her service role, we helped to prepare bags of food. _ , this got to be something we looked forward to and we always left feeling _ about what we did. My sweet mom _ made doing housework enjoyable. The best _ I learned from her that sticks with me today is \"O-H-I-O\". Growing up, my mom would _ me a pile of clean clothes and I would _ set them on the floor, _ to put them away later. My mom would say, \"Kids, you've got to _ : OHIO! That means Only Handle It Once. When I give you clothes, put them away in your _ as soon as I give them to you so they are only in your hands _ .\" Today, as a forty-two-year-old wife and stepmom, when I pick up my mail or bring clean, _ clothes to my room, I hear my _ mom's voice in my head: \"Remember, OHIO!\" Most of the time, I take those extra two minutes to handle things only once and put them in their _ place. Who knew that this girl from Virginia would learn such a/an _ lesson about OHIO that stays with me still today?
