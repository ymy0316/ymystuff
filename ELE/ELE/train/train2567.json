It depends on how _ you hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it isOK. If I hold it for a(n) _ , I will have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you will have to _ an ambulance. It is exactly the _ weight, but the longer I hold it, the _ it becomes.\" The whole audience became silent, lost in thought. After a moment, the lecturer continued, \" _ we carry our burden all the time, _ , we will not be able tocarry on with the burden becoming increasingly heavier, _ heavy for us to bear.\" \"What you have to do is to _ the glass, rest for a while _ holding it up again.\" As is shown in the story above, we have to put down the burden periodically, _ we can be refreshed and are able to carry on. So before you _ home from work tonight, put the burden of _ down. Don\"t carry it back _ . You can pick it up tomorrow. Whatever burden you are having now on your _ , let it down for a moment if you can.
