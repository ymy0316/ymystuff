There, lying in her hospital bed, she would swear that she was _ going to be walking again one day. She was moved to a specialized _ hospital in the San Francisco Bay area. All _ that could be applied to her case were used. The doctors were moved by her undefeatable spirit. They taught her about imaging about seeing herself walking. If it would do _ else, it would at least give her hope and something _ to do in the long waking hours in her bed.
