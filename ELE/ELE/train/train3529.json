{"article": "Scientists say that something very serious is happening to the earth. It will begin to get _ in the following years. There will be major changes in _ in the new century. Coastal waters will have a _ temperature. This will have a _ effect on agriculture. In northern areas, the _ season will be ten days longer by the year 2010. However, in warmer areas, it will be too dry. The _ of water could _ by eighty percent. This would _ a large decrease in agriculture production.

This could cause the _ sheets to melt and raise the _ of the oceans _ one to two meters. Many coastal cities would be _ water. Why is this happening? There is too _ carbon dioxide in the air. _ oil, gas and coal burn, they create large amounts of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide lets _ enter the earth's atmosphere and _ the earth. However, it doesn't let as much heat _ the atmosphere and enter space. It's like a blanket. The heat _ the sun can pass through the blanket to warm the earth. The heat _ there and can't escape through the blanket again. Scientists call this the green-house effect.", "options": [["warmer", "colder", "better", "worse"], ["land", "agriculture", "climate", "weather"], ["lower", "higher", "normal", "proper"], ["good", "general", "serious", "useful"], ["getting", "playing", "taking", "growing"], ["much", "many", "amount", "number"], ["fall", "decrease", "refuse", "rise"], ["lead", "keep", "make", "cause"], ["increase", "drop", "lift", "realize"], ["water", "rain", "stone", "ice"], ["degree", "level", "coast", "area"], ["by", "to", "of", "with"], ["above", "under", "below", "over"], ["little", "many", "few", "much"], ["If", "Because", "When", "Why"], ["sunlight", "air", "rain", "gas"], ["cold", "protect", "hurt", "heat"], ["enter", "get", "leave", "reach"], ["through", "by", "from", "on"], ["stores", "arrives", "stands", "stays"]], "answers": ["A", "C", "B", "C", "D", "C", "B", "D", "A", "D", "B", "A", "B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "C", "C", "D"]}
